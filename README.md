# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to further develop the PlanMyTrip App by adding the weather description to the weather data already retrieved.

In addition, the App customer will be able to filter their search based on their weather preferences which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

The App customer will then be able to select four cities to create a travel itinerary and route, indicated on a map with a marker.

## Results 
Developing this functionality for PlanMyTrip was definitely a challenge where new tools, code, and resources had to be researched.  Many a long hour was spent staring at a screen wondering why the code was failing.  GitGuardian came to my rescue to let me know that I had exposed my API key, so a new key had to be created.

My original travel destination selection included Hawaiian islands.  However, I had to choose new travel destinations because I was unable to route my travel across the ocean.

## Summary 
Watching the code bring the maps to life was fascinating.  In addition, I really want to go travelling now!

One limitation I noticed was that "SAILING" was not an acceptable mode of transit, thereby limiting options for those that want to travel by sea.
